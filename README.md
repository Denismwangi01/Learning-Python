# Learning-Python
- Learning Python Basics: Variables, Control Structures, loops and functions üêç
- This repository is where I'm sharing the Python programs I worked on while learning about variables, control structures, and basic programs.

## What This Repository Is About
- This repo contains 3 simple Python programs :

`Variables.py`

- Demonstrates variable declaration and basic control structures.
- Includes a nested control structure to check conditions and print messages.


`Calculator_program.py`

-  simple calculator that lets users choose between addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
-  input validation and handles division by zero.
- What I Learned Today
## Variables

- Variables are used to store data like names, ages, and cities.
- Python lets you assign and use variables dynamically.

## Control Structures

- Conditional Statements (if, elif, else): Used to perform different actions based on conditions.
- Nested Conditions: Conditions inside other conditions for more specific checks.


## loops and function

The multiplication table generator prompts the user for a number and displays its multiplication table from 1 to 10. 
This project uses a for loop to iterate through numbers 1 to 10 and compute the product.

## How It Works

- The user inputs a number.

- The program calls the multiplication_table function, which:

- Prints the multiplication table header.

- Iterates through numbers 1 to 10 using a for loop.

- Computes and prints the product for each iteration.


The "Guess the Number" game generates a random number between 1 and 10. 

The user repeatedly guesses the number until they guess correctly. This project uses a while loop to keep the game running until the correct number is guessed.

`loops.py`

## What Are Functions?

- Functions in Python are reusable blocks of code that perform specific tasks. They help in organizing code, improving readability, and avoiding repetition.

## Topics Covered

1. Defining and Calling Functions

We learned how to create a function using the def keyword and call it when needed.

2. Functions with Parameters

Functions can take arguments to make them more dynamic.

3. Functions with Return Values

Functions can return values instead of printing them.

4. Default Parameter Values

We can set default values for parameters.

5. Using Functions with Loops

We combined functions and loops to check whether numbers are odd or even


## What is File Handling?

- File handling in Python allows you to create, read, write, and update files. The built-in open() function is used to work with files.
