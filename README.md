# Learning-Python
- Learning Python Basics: Variables and Control Structures üêç
- This repository is where I'm sharing the Python programs I worked on while learning about variables, control structures, and basic programs.

## What This Repository Is About
- This repo contains two simple Python programs I wrote today:

`Variables.py`

- Demonstrates variable declaration and basic control structures.
- Includes a nested control structure to check conditions and print messages.


`Calculator_program.py`

-  simple calculator that lets users choose between addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
-  input validation and handles division by zero.
- What I Learned Today
## Variables

- Variables are used to store data like names, ages, and cities.
- Python lets you assign and use variables dynamically.

## Control Structures

- Conditional Statements (if, elif, else): Used to perform different actions based on conditions.
- Nested Conditions: Conditions inside other conditions for more specific checks.


## Next?
- I‚Äôm excited to keep learning and will be adding more Python programs as I continue my journey. My next goal is to work on loops and functions!

Feel free to check out my code and leave feedback if you‚Äôd like! üòä
